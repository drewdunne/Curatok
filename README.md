# Curatok

## Why Curatok?
Tiktok is a great platform for discovering interesting, diverse content. However users looking for the highest-quality content on a very specific topic, will find their home feed often unrelated and frequently distracting. Those who use the in-app TikTok search feature are ultimately met with poor search filtering and low quality results. Combing through hundreds or thousands of videos with no idea of the content quality can be a headache.

Curatok enables users to re-discover the highest quality TikTok content they've encountered related to their specific topic of interest.

## Getting Started
To begin, clone the repo and run:
 `npm install`

Once completed, you can ensure all tests function correct by running `npm run test`

If any tests fail, please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/drewdunne/Curatok/issues)

If all tests pass, continue and run  `npm start`

**Be sure to set your "liked videos" to public** before proceeding to the next step.

Once completed, enter your TikTok username on the login screen to inform Curatok where it needs to search for your video content.

- Collecting and saving your Liked Videos
- Browsing videos with lazy-loading
- Persistent, session-based authentication and authorization
