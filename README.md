# Curatok

## Why Curatok?
Tiktok is a great platform for discovering interesting, diverse content. However users looking for the highest-quality content on a very specific topic, will find their home feed often unrelated and frequently distracting. Even worse, Those who use the in-app TikTok search feature are ultimately met with poor search filtering and low quality results. When great content is found, it cannot be categorized by more than a single label. Combing through hundreds or thousands of videos to discover the content you seek can often be a headache.

Curatok enables users to re-discover the highest quality TikTok content they've encountered related to their specific topic of interest.
